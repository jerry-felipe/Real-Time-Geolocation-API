# Real-Time-Geolocation-API
A backend system for tracking and managing location data in real time. It supports live updates for deliveries or users, integrates with tools like Google Maps API, and optimizes geospatial queries using PostGIS. With caching via Redis and a scalable architecture, it ensures low-latency performance for location-based services.

# Features  
- Real-Time Updates: Track users or assets with low latency.  
- Geospatial Optimization: Efficient queries using PostGIS or similar tools.  
- Google Maps Integration: Enable routing, distance calculation, and mapping.  
- Caching: Accelerate performance with Redis.  
- Scalability: Handle high traffic with a resilient architecture.  

# Technologies Used  
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python) or similar frameworks like Node.js or Spring Boot.  
- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data.  
- Caching: Redis for optimized query performance.  
- Geolocation API: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap integration.  
- Containerization: Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
